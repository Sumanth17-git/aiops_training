Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to setting up Dynatrace OneAgent using an Ansible playbook. This playbook assumes you are deploying the OneAgent on Linux servers.
Prerequisites
Dynatrace account: Ensure you have access to your Dynatrace environment and have the installation script URL.
Ansible control node: Ensure Ansible is installed and configured on your control machine.
Target hosts: These should be Linux machines with SSH access from the Ansible control node.
## Installation script URL: Obtain the OneAgent installation script URL from your Dynatrace environment. For example:

```bash
https://<environment-id>.live.dynatrace.com/api/v1/deployment/installer/agent/unix/default/latest?Api-Token=<token>&arch=x86


### Step 1: Test Ansible Connection to the Hosts
Run the following command to verify the connection to all target hosts:

```bash
ansible all -m ping -i inventory.ini

### Step 2: Run the Ansible Playbook
Execute the following command to deploy the Dynatrace OneAgent on the target hosts:

```bash
ansible-playbook dynatrace_oneagent.yml -i inventory.ini --extra-vars "@vars.yml"


### Explanation of Tasks

1. **Install Required Tools**  
   Ensures `curl` and `tar` are installed on the target hosts to support the installation process.

2. **Download the Installer**  
   Downloads the Dynatrace OneAgent installer script to the `/tmp` directory.

3. **Run the Installer**  
   Executes the installer script with the required parameter:  
   - `APP_LOG_CONTENT_ACCESS=1`: Enables log monitoring.

4. **Start and Enable Service**  
   Ensures the `oneagent` service is running and configured to start automatically on boot.

5. **Clean Up**  
   Deletes the installer script from the `/tmp` directory to save space and enhance security.
